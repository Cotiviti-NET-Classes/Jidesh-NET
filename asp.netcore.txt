Unlike languages like Ruby and JavaScript, 
C# has you define the type of each data in a program. 
Assigning a type essentially tells a computer what operations 
can and cannot be performed on a piece of data. 
This style of coding helps programmers avoid a large class 
of errors that are common to Ruby and JavaScript

If you’re familiar with Java, you’ll recognize 
how C# programs are built—by defining objects 
that interact with each other, which makes code 
reusable and easy to manage.

Console.WriteLine() is a command that prints text to a console. 
Whatever is in between the parentheses will be printed 
to the console!


Getting Input
The command Console.ReadLine() captures 
text that a user types into the console.

static void main()
{
    console.WriteLine("How old are you");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();
    console.WriteLine($"You are {input} years old");
}


Comments
Ironically, an essential tool in programming is the ability 
to tell a computer to ignore a part of a program. 
Text written in a program but not run by the computer 
is called a comment. 
In C#, anything after a // or between /* and */ is a comment. 
In spoken word we call these symbols “forward slashes” and “asterisks”.
