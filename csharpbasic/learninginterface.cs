Interface has multiple uses


In one word interface is a contract

-> enforces rules
-> Decoupling
-> Abstraction
-> Signature
-> Standardization
-> Versioning
-> Multiple Inheritance


use an interface explicit contract where caller and calle
are decoupled from each other. Impact analysis, change detection
Runtime we will have less problems


contract is nothing but the legal binding entities

Irrespective you use unterface or you do not use it

There is always a contract between caller and callee

Interface class should be  Abstract i.e. show only what is necessary

Multiple inheritance in interfaces helps to minimize impact on client updates
