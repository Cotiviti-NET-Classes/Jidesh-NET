/*

Interface has multiple uses


In one word interface is a contract

-> enforces rules
-> Decoupling
-> Abstraction
-> Signature
-> Standardization
-> Versioning
-> Multiple Inheritance


contract is nothing but the legal binding entities

Irrespective you use unterface or you do not use it

There is always a contract between caller and callee
