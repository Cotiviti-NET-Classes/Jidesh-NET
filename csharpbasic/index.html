ASP.NET core is new version of  ASP.NET by Microsoft. 
It is an open-source web framework which can be run on 
Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Install donet sdk in your machine

check in cmd and verify the installation

type
dotnet --version
to check the version



type 
dotnet new --list to view all the tamplate

to create console app
you can write following command in you terminal

dotnet new console -n appname


Unlike languages like Ruby and JavaScript, 
C# has you define the type of each data in a program. 
Assigning a type essentially tells a computer what operations 
can and cannot be performed on a piece of data. 
This style of coding helps programmers avoid a large class 
of errors that are common to Ruby and JavaScript

If you’re familiar with Java, you’ll recognize 
how C# programs are built—by defining objects 
that interact with each other, which makes code 
reusable and easy to manage.

Console.WriteLine() is a command that prints text to a console. 
Whatever is in between the parentheses will be printed 
to the console!


Getting Input
The command Console.ReadLine() captures 
text that a user types into the console.

static void main()
{
    console.WriteLine("How old are you");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();
    console.WriteLine($"You are {input} years old");
}


Comments
Ironically, an essential tool in programming is the ability 
to tell a computer to ignore a part of a program. 
Text written in a program but not run by the computer 
is called a comment. 
In C#, anything after a // or between /* and */ is a comment. 
In spoken word we call these symbols “forward slashes” and “asterisks”.


C# have go very good community support


Let's know something comman about asp.net core

asp.net core is an open source framework

asp.net core application can target all .net framwork and standard

asp.net core supports all windows, linux and machine

Main method is entry point of ASP.NET application

static files can be served from wwwroot folder

the host for asp.net core web application is configured in program.cs file

asp.net core web application uses kestrel as an internal web server by default

first command in .net CLI is dotnet

startup class must include configure method

configureservice method in startup class is use to registering services with IOC container

Millware executes on each request in asp.net core application

middleware can be configured using instance of type IApplicationBuilder

Middleware can be configured in Configure method of startup class

ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT is environment variable in ASP.NET core application

useExceptionHandler extension method allow us to configure custom error handling route

Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles middleware must be installed to serve static files in ASP.NET Core application

.net core application are portable and self contained

self contained application can be installed and run on any platform without .net core runtime

we should target .net standard for the code sharing of .net core application

to create logs in asp.net core application we need to get ILogger objcet from IoC container




The main objective of .NET Core is to make .NET Framework 
open-source, cross-platform compatible that can be used in a 
wide variety of verticals, from the data center 
to touch-based devices.

.net core includes CLI tools for development and continuios integration

can be deploy user-wide or system wide or with Docker Containers



Both dotnet 3.1  and .NET Core 2.1 will have long term support.

.NET Core 3.x applications only run on .NET Core Framework.

.NET Core 2.x applications run on .NET Core as well as .NET Framework.

.NET Core Composition
The .NET Core Framework composed of the following parts:


<table> 
    <tr>
        <td>
.netcore
    <tr>
<td>CLI Tools</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
<td> Roslyn</td>
     </tr> 
    <tr>
<td>CoreFX</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
<td>CoreCLR</td>
    </tr>


</td>
</tr>
</table>



asp.net core web application project structure

you get the following folder structure

obj 
pages
properties
wwwroot
appname.csproj
appnamesettings.Development.json
appnamesettings.json 
program.cs




.csproj file includes setting related to targeted .NET Framework,
project folder , NuGet package references etc


Properties
The Properties node includes launchSettings.json file which includes Visual Studio profiles of debug settings.


wwwroot folder

wwwroot folder in the ASP.NET Core project is treated as a web root folder. 
Static files can be stored in any folder under the web root and accessed 
with a relative path to that root.
Generally, there should be separate folders for the different types of 
static files such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, library scripts etc.

you need to include a middleware for serving static files in the Configure method of Startup.cs.




CLI Tools: A set of tooling for development and deployment.
Roslyn: Language compiler for C# and Visual Basic
CoreFX: Set of framework libraries.
CoreCLR: A JIT based CLR (Command Language Runtime).

The following is a command structure.

dotnet < command > < argument > < option >

        Enums
        Why are Enums required?
        Enums are strongly typed constants.

        if a program uses set of integral number, consider replacing them with enums.
        otherwise the program becomes launchSettings
        *Readable
        *maintainable

        emums are strongly typed constants. Hence an explict cast is needed to 
        convert from enumstype to integral type and vice versa


        also an enum of one type cannot be implicitly assign to an enum of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same

        THe default underlying type of an enum is int

        the default value of first element is zero and gets incremented by 1
        
        It is possible to customized the underlying type and values

        Enum are value types
        
        Enum keyworda(all small letter) is used to create enumerations 
        where as Enum class contains staticgetvalue() and getNames()
        method which can be used to list enum underlying type value and getNames

        Some key points of a static constructor are: 

A static constructor does not take access modifiers or have parameters.
A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the class before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.
A static constructor cannot be called directly.
The user has no control over when the static constructor is executed in the program.
A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.

Private Constructor in C#
When a constructor is created with a private specifier, it is not possible for other classes to derive from this class, neither is it possible to create an instance of this class. They are usually used in classes that contain static members only. Some key points of a private constructor are:

One use of a private constructor is when we have only static members.
It provides an implementation of a singleton class pattern
Once we provide a constructor that is either private or public or any, the compiler will not add the parameter-less public constructor to the class.


write only and read only property of C#


Readonly property

Set is used for insert.
so if we don't want to insert value we don't use set
so this is called read only

if there is only geeter than its read only property


Writeonly property
for this we only used set method

We know that C# supports const and readonly variables and generally uses them interchangeably, but we also should notice that they offer different behaviors. Always remember, const is compile time and readonly is runtime. This will always help in choosing the correct one according to the situation.    

Let’s look into the behavior of both of these in detail:

const (Compile time constant)

const are “compile time constants”. Compile time constants are a bit faster than run time constants. When performance is the highest criteria and we are sure that value of constant will not change for different release, use const. 


Readonly (Run time constant)

readonly defines “run time constants”. Run time constants are a bit slower but are more flexible than compile time constants. The main difference between these are that they are resolved at run time, which means whenever we use a readonly variable it is referenced while when we use const the value is used.
