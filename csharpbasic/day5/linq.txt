Language Integrated Query (LINQ) 
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration 
of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are 
expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. 

You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and 
familiar operators. The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for 
objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML)


Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax.
By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping 
operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression 
patterns to query and transform data in SQL databases, ADO.NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, 
and .NET collections.
